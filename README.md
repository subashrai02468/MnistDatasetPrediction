# MNIST Dataset Prediction

This repository contains code and documentation for predicting handwritten digit images using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large number of handwritten digit images, each labeled with the corresponding digit from 0 to 9.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the digits present in handwritten images from the MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision and has a wide range of applications, such as optical character recognition (OCR), digit classification, and more.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install statsmodels matplotlib
pip install folium
```

You can install these libraries using the provided commands. Additionally, you may need other libraries depending on your specific machine learning framework or tools of choice.

## Data

The MNIST dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size, but it can be easily obtained from various online sources. You can download the dataset in a format compatible with your machine learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Data Preprocessing

Before building a machine learning model, it's essential to preprocess the data. Data preprocessing steps often include:

- Loading the dataset
- Exploring the dataset to understand its structure
- Handling missing values
- Normalizing or scaling the data
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

In this project, we preprocess the data by loading it, exploring its structure, and performing necessary data cleaning.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the dataset better. During EDA, we perform various analyses and visualizations to gain insights into the data. This can include:

- Visualizing data distributions
- Identifying correlations between features
- Detecting outliers
- Exploring relationships between variables

In this project, we conduct EDA to visualize the MNIST dataset and gain insights into the distribution of digits.

## Model Building

The core of this project is building a machine learning model for digit recognition. We use a linear regression model to predict the prices based on the selected features. Additionally, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to improve the model's performance.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained on a training dataset and evaluated on a separate testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for regression problems include Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

We assess the model's performance on both the training and testing datasets to ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

## Results

The results of the machine learning model, including RMSE and MAE on the training and testing datasets, are presented in the project code. These metrics help us assess the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully built a machine learning model to predict digit images using the MNIST dataset. We demonstrated the steps involved in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, training, and evaluation.
